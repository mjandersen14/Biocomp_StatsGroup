Comments for Peer Review of R Stats Group (user fjhuizar):

Coding looks good, seems reusable, and appears to run correctly for the students.
There is some extra information that is not necessary for the project but seems helpful - ex: plotting histograms.
Hard to give specific critiques given that we do not know R, but the code was explained to us well.
Comparing the right things, proper number of simulations, getting results for all of the ANOVAs as well as the regression.
All of the commenting is helpful in explaining each step of the code.
